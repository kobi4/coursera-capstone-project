Long lines of cars barely moving. \n\n    As you keep driving, police cars start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. \n\n    Oh, it is an accident and there is a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the nearest hospital. \n\n    They must be in critical condition for all of this to be happening. \n\n    Now, wouldn't it be great if there is something in place that could warn you, \n\n    given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, \n\n    so that you would drive more carefully or even change your travel if you are able to.\n\n\nSo, the problem we have at hand here is: **How to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community.**\n"

            "source": "### 01.02. Target Audience / Stakeholders\n\nData science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem. Let me describe here the target audience to the problem solution and why they would care about it.\nRecall that our problem is how to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community. Let us think then who the Target Audience / Stakeholders are here:\n\n-\tFirst and foremost, it is the community itself. The drivers who want to avoid those kind of accidents (both in participating in such accidents and in avoiding the long lines and delays when such accidents occur on their route ahead). Very often than not, we use GPS software like Waze which instruct us to change our normal route due to an accident ahead and that alone causes delays in our drive time. What if we could minimize those accidents in the first place.\n\n\n-\tThe traffic-police. The less traffic accidents there are, the more availability the traffic policemen and policewomen are for their ongoing day to day work. Also, with long lines of cars behind such accident, it is more difficult for the traffic police car to reach the accident scene.\n\n\n-\tTraffic Command and Control Center. Especially in large urban cities, the more accidents, the more \u201cheadache\u201d for the people at the Command and Control Center to resolve the traffic jams, handle re-routes and restore the normal order.\n\n\n-\tHospitals and Ambulance teams. Obviously, as traffic accidents rate lowers, also the number of people hurt in those accidents is decreased. So there is less need in sending ambulances/helicopters to the problematic locations of the accidents and there is reduction in the need to treat people in hospitals allowing the medical professionals to provide more attention and care to non-accidents related patients.\n\n\n-\tInsurance companies. This is another given. The less accidents there are, the less payments the insurance companies need to provide both on car damages and people\u2019s health related damages (including life insurance in cases of deaths).\n\n\n-\tAnother beneficiate for the solution to the problem is the various workplaces of the people that wait in the long accidents lines on their way to work. Had there been the accidents, they could have been already working and produce profit to the companies they work at. \n"

            "source": "### 02.02. Data Understanding\n\nTo better understand the data, I performed the following tasks: \n\na.\tObserve the csv file that was provided and the meta data file that describes it\n\n(can be located under: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf )\n\nb.\tDecide on the Predictor or Target Variable. It did not take long to understand that this should be the \u2018SEVERITYCODE\u2019 field because it is used measure the severity of an accident. According to the Meta Data file description, there are several types of Severity Codes: \n- 0 (Unknown)\n<font color=green>\n- 1 (Property Damage Only Collision)\n- 2 (Injury Collision)\n</font>\n- 2b (Serious Injury)\n- 3 (Fatality)\n\nHowever, in the csv file provided, there are only records with SeverityCode of either 1 or 2. So, I decided to check how the attributes mentioned later below (item d) can predict a severity code of either 1 or 2.\n\nc.\tDecide which fields are irrelevant. When browsing through the csv data, I decided that there were quite a few columns that I would not use for this model. Below are those columns with the reasoning: \n\u2022\t\u2018SEVERITYCODE\u2019 \u2013 This column is a duplicate and appears twice, it will be used only once.\n\u2022\t\u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019, \u2018OBJECTID\u2019, \u2018INCKEY\u2019, \u2018COLDETKEY\u2019, \u2018REPORTNO\u2019, \u2018STATUS\u2019, \u2018INTKEY\u2019, \u2018LOCATION\u2019, \u2018EXCEPTRSNCODE\u2019, \u2018EXCEPTRSNDESC\u2019, \u2018SEVERITYDESC\u2019, \u2018INCDATE\u2019, \u2018INCDTTM\u2019, \u2018SDOT_COLCODE\u2019, \u2018SDOT_COLDESC\u2019, \u2018SDOTCOLNUM\u2019, \u2018ST_COLCODE\u2019, \u2018ST_COLDESC\u2019, \u2018SEGLANEKEY\u2019, \u2018CROSSWALKKEY\u2019\n\nThe reason for not using them is that they do not provide any value to the classifications.\n\u2022\t\u2018INATTENTIONIND\u2019, \u2018PEDROWNOTGRNT\u2019, \u2018SPEEDING\u2019\n\nWhile those three columns could provide valuable data to the algorithm (\u201cWhether or not collision was due to inattention (Y/N)\u201d, \u201cWhether or not the pedestrian right of way was not granted. (Y/N)\u201d and \u201cWhether or not speeding was a factor in the collision. (Y/N)\u201d (respectively)), I could not use them because in the csv data the values they had were either blank (empty value) or \u2018Y\u2019 and I could not tell whether the empty value represents a \u2018N\u2019 value or a missing data.\n\nd.\tSo, by the process of elimination, I was left with the relevant fields which became the attributes listed below that weigh the severity of an accident (either \u20181\u2019 or \u20182\u2019). In other words, to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an algorithm must be developed to predict the severity of an accident given:\n\n-\t'ADDRTYPE' - The collision address type (Possible values: \u2018Alley\u2019, \u2018Block\u2019, \u2018Intersection\u2019)\n-\t'COLLISIONTYPE' \u2013 Collision Type (Possible values: 'Angles', 'Cycles', \n'Head On', 'Left Turn', 'Parked Car', 'Pedestrian', 'Rear Ended', 'Right Turn', 'Sideswipe')\n-\t'PERSONCOUNT' - The total number of people involved in the collision\n-\t'PEDCOUNT' - The number of pedestrians involved in the collision\n-\t'PEDCYLCOUNT' - The number of bicycles involved in the collision\n-\t'VEHCOUNT' - The number of vehicles involved in the collision\n-\t'JUNCTIONTYPE' - Category of junction at which collision took place (Possible values: 'At Intersection (but not related to intersection)', 'At Intersection (intersection related)', 'Driveway Junction', 'Mid-Block (but intersection related)', 'Mid-Block (not related to intersection)', 'Ramp Junction')\n-\t'UNDERINFL' - Whether a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol (Possible values: \u20180\u2019, \u20181\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019, \u2018N\u2019)\n-\t'WEATHER' - The weather conditions during the time of the collision (Possible values: 'Blowing Sand/Dirt', 'Clear', 'Fog/Smog/Smoke', 'Overcast', 'Partly Cloudy', 'Raining',\n'Severe Crosswind', 'Sleet/Hail/Freezing Rain', 'Snowing')\n-\t'ROADCOND' - The condition of the road during the collision (Possible values: 'Dry', 'Ice', 'Oil', 'Sand/Mud/Dirt', 'Snow/Slush', 'Standing Water', 'Wet')\n-\t'LIGHTCOND' - The light conditions during the collision (Possible values: 'Dark - No Street Lights', 'Dark - Street Lights Off', 'Dark - Street Lights On', 'Dawn', 'Daylight', 'Dusk')\n-\t'HITPARKEDCAR' - Whether the collision involved hitting a parked car (Possible values: \u2018Y\u2019, \u2018N\u2019)\n"
